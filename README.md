I would like to highlight 

E vs t convergence plot.ipynb

which demonstrates that energy is transferred between the outer planet and the inner binary and back again, and that this is not an artifact of the error introduced by the numerical integration scheme, since neither the behavior nor the amplitude of the energy transfer depends on step size of the numerical integration

Data is fed to this analysis routine by a previous piece of code
